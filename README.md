# Space Shooter - a 2D Game for Android

## Content of the Game
In this game the goal is to collect as many coins as possible, while you are flying though space with your spaceship. 
But be careful: Try to avoid or shoot the asteroids, since every collision with them will cost you one life.

## Technology
The whole application was developed in Unity with the programming language C#.

## Setup 
To play the game, just download [this apk](export/SpaceShooterAPK.apk) and install it on your Android phone. 

## Demo
[Click here](DemoSpaceShooter.mp4) to watch a short demo video of the application. You have to download the video to watch it, since GitHub doesn't support displaying such large files.
